        const flashcards = [
            { question: "When was the Nazi Party founded and what was it originally called?", answer: "The Nazi Party (NSDAP) was founded in January 1919 as the German Workers' Party (DAP) by Anton Drexler. Hitler joined in September 1919 and quickly rose to leadership. In 1920, Hitler renamed it the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and introduced the swastika as its symbol." },
            { question: "What were the key beliefs of the Nazi Party in the 25-Point Programme?", answer: "The 25-Point Programme, announced in February 1920, included extreme nationalism, anti-Semitism, the rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, a call for expansion (Lebensraum), a strong authoritarian leader (Führer), and the suppression of communism and democracy." },
            { question: "What was the role of the SA (Stormtroopers)?", answer: "The SA (Sturmabteilung), led by Ernst Röhm, was a paramilitary force used to protect Nazi rallies, intimidate political enemies (especially communists and socialists), and violently disrupt opposition. By 1932, the SA had over 400,000 members." },
            { question: "What was the Munich Putsch (1923) and why did it happen?", answer: "The Munich Putsch was an attempted coup by Hitler and the Nazis to overthrow the Weimar government in Bavaria on 8-9 November 1923. Hitler believed the political situation was ripe for a revolution, citing the perceived weakness of the Weimar government and growing unrest." },
            { question: "Why did the Munich Putsch fail?", answer: "The putsch failed because the Bavarian government withdrew its support. The police and army confronted Hitler’s forces, resulting in 16 Nazi deaths and Hitler's arrest. The attempt at overthrowing the government ended in failure and exposed Hitler’s lack of military support." },
            { question: "What were the consequences of the Munich Putsch?", answer: "Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison but served only nine months. His trial gained him national attention, and he used his time in prison to write 'Mein Kampf', which outlined his ideas about nationalism, anti-Semitism, and the need for a strong, centralized government." },
            { question: "What was Mein Kampf and why was it important?", answer: "'Mein Kampf' ('My Struggle') was Hitler’s autobiography and political manifesto, written during his imprisonment in 1924. It outlined his extreme nationalist and anti-Semitic views, his vision of Lebensraum (expansion of German territory), and his belief in the need for a powerful, authoritarian state." },
            { question: "How did the Nazis change their tactics after the Munich Putsch?", answer: "After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Hitler realized that the Nazis needed to pursue power legally through democratic means. The Nazis focused on building a broad base of support, forming alliances with conservative groups, using mass propaganda, and running candidates in elections to increase their influence." },
            { question: "What was the impact of the Wall Street Crash (1929) on Germany?", answer: "The Wall Street Crash led to a global economic depression that severely affected Germany. Unemployment skyrocketed, reaching 6 million by 1932, and the economy collapsed. The Weimar government struggled to respond effectively, which contributed to widespread disillusionment with the democratic system." },
            { question: "How did the Great Depression help the Nazis?", answer: "The Great Depression caused widespread suffering and disillusionment with the Weimar Republic. The Nazis capitalized on this by offering promises of economic recovery, jobs, and national pride. They blamed Jews and communists for Germany’s problems, gaining support from those who were desperate for change." },
            { question: "What role did propaganda play in Nazi success?", answer: "Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, skillfully used mass media—such as posters, radio, films, and rallies—to spread Nazi ideology. The propaganda portrayed Hitler as a strong, decisive leader who would restore Germany to greatness, while demonizing Jews and communists as the source of the country’s problems." },
            { question: "What was the significance of the July 1932 election?", answer: "In the July 1932 Reichstag elections, the Nazis became the largest party, winning 230 seats. However, they still lacked a majority. Despite this, the Nazis were seen as a rising political force, and their success put increasing pressure on the Weimar government." },
            { question: "Why did Hitler become Chancellor in January 1933?", answer: "In January 1933, President Hindenburg, influenced by conservative elites, appointed Hitler as Chancellor, believing they could control him and use his popularity to stabilize the country. Hindenburg’s decision was motivated by the belief that the Nazi party could be harnessed to deal with the growing communist threat." },
            { question: "What was the significance of Hitler becoming Chancellor?", answer: "Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor gave him legal access to power. He quickly moved to consolidate his control by eliminating political opposition, using the Reichstag Fire as a pretext to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act, which gave him dictatorial powers." },
            { question: "What was the Reichstag Fire (1933) and how did it help Hitler?", answer: "The Reichstag Fire, which occurred on 27 February 1933, was a pivotal event that Hitler used to justify cracking down on communists and civil liberties. He convinced President Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree, allowing the Nazis to arrest political opponents and suppress opposition parties." },
            { question: "What was the Enabling Act (1933)?", answer: "The Enabling Act, passed on 24 March 1933, gave Hitler the power to make laws without Reichstag approval, effectively allowing him to rule by decree. This marked the end of parliamentary democracy in Germany and solidified Hitler’s dictatorship." },
            { question: "How did Hitler eliminate political opposition?", answer: "After the Enabling Act, Hitler used the power of the state to dismantle democratic institutions and suppress opposition. He banned all political parties except the Nazis, silenced the press, and used the SS and Gestapo to intimidate and arrest political opponents." },
            { question: "How did Hitler consolidate power after becoming Chancellor?", answer: "Hitler consolidated power by passing laws to strengthen his control, including the dissolution of trade unions, the establishment of the Gestapo, and the purging of his rivals within the Nazi Party during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934." },
            { question: "What was the Night of the Long Knives (1934)?", answer: "The Night of the Long Knives, on 30 June 1934, was a purge where Hitler ordered the execution of several leaders of the SA, including Ernst Röhm, and other political opponents. This solidified Hitler’s control over the Nazi Party and eliminated potential rivals." }
